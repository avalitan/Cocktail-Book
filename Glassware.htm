  <h2 id="A_Types_of_Bar_Glasses">A. Types of Bar Glasses</h2>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/different-types-of-bar-glasses-hs-2018.jpg" alt="Chart showing the different types of bar glasses" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <h3 id="1_Cocktail">1. Cocktail</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tall-cocktail-glass-hay-031918.jpg" alt="Used to serve drinks without any ice, this classic glass has a cone bowl that has been inverted." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p> Used to serve drinks without any ice, this classic glass has a cone bowl that has been inverted. They usually hold up to six ounces, although it is possible to buy smaller ones. Because the mouth of the glass is so large, you can easily get your nose and face close to your drink, which will allow you to breathe in the aromas of your beverage and fully enjoy it. </p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="2_Highball">2. Highball</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2.Highball-glasses.jpg" alt="Green highball glasses" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Wider and shorter than a Collins glass but taller than an Old Fashioned glass, Highball glasses are perfect for most mixed drinks and cocktails. They hold 8-12 ounces of liquid and are generally used for drinks that have more mixer in them than alcohol.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="3_Zombie">3. Zombie</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3.Zombie-glass.jpg" alt="Zombie bar glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Originally used to serve a drink called the Zombie, these glasses are still very popular due to how straight the lines are and how stylish they appear. This glass is generally taller than other glass options and can actually be around 7 inches tall. They are frosted or clear, and both will showcase the beauty of the drink and its unique colors. Due to their taller size, they generally hold about 13.5 ounces of liquid.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="4_Collins">4. Collins</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4.Collins-bar-glass-min.png" alt="Collins glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>These glasses average about 12 ounces in capacity, but some will easily hold 14. They are tall, cylindrical, and normal made of regular or frosted glass. While you can use a Highball glass in a pinch, it is nice to be able to serve your beverages in the correct glass. </p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="5_Sling">5. Sling</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/5.Sling-glasses-min.png" alt="Sling bar glasses" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>This tall and thin glass is perfect for a lot of drinks but most notably used for Long Island Ice Teas. They have a small foot at the base, which make them perfect for parties, as they are much more difficult to knock over than other glasses are. Due to how slim they are, they are easy and comfortable to hold and while they are designed for a certain beverage, they will hold any drink that you want to enjoy in style.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="6_Irish_Coffee">6. Irish Coffee</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/6.Irish-Coffee-Glass-min.png" alt="Irish Coffee glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>If you are going to be enjoying a warm alcoholic beverage then you will want this type of glass, as they have small handles and are heat-resistant. This ensures that you can easily drink your beverage without burning your hands. The flared opening of these glasses allows there to be some foam on top of the drink. </p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="7_Old_Fashioned">7. Old Fashioned</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/7.Old-fashioned-bar-glass-min.png" alt="Old Fashioned drink glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Also called a “lowball glass”, these glasses have a solid base that are perfect for muddling drinks in them. They are squatter and more solid to hold than a Highball glass. Some people also use these glasses when they are going to be drinking their liquor neat and enjoy that the glass can easily be held in a number of ways without worrying about dropping or spilling their drink.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="8_Rocks">8. Rocks</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8.Rocks-glass-min.png" alt="Rocks bar glasses" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>This glass is ideal for any kind of cocktail that you want to enjoy as well as having liquor straight up on some ice. While they are shorter glasses, there is plenty to hold on to so that there is no risk of accidentally dropping the drink. In addition, they are wide enough to easily hold plenty of ice to keep the drink nice and cold and still accommodate a stirrer. The wide opening at the top ensures that the drinker will be able to smell and really enjoy their beverage.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="9_Tumbler">9. Tumbler</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/9.Tumbler-glass-min.png" alt="Tumbler glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>This is a great glass that can be used in a number of ways. While there is no stem, which means that the drink will heat up more in the hand, the curve of the glass ensures that the beverage smells and tastes great. This is a flat bottomed glass that is perfect for most uses, and although it’s possible to buy ones that have smaller openings on the top, opting for one that is nice and wide will ensure that the drinker can really enjoy their beverage.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="10_Martini">10. Martini</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/10.Martini-Glass-min.png" alt="Martini glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Serving sizes have gotten larger and martini glasses have grown with them. They are similar to a basic cocktail glass but the bowl is usually larger and completely conical at the bottom. Again, like margarita glasses, you can have stems in a number of designs. From classic to funky, there’s something for everyone.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="11_Margarita">11. Margarita</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/11.Margarita-glasses-min.png" alt="Margarita glasses" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>This is a variant of a cocktail glass and is traditionally only used to serve margaritas. They come in all sizes, from small to fishbowl, and can have different types of stems, depending on your preference. From straight to curvy to zigzag, you can pick a stem that will match the rest of your glasses and décor. Margaritas are often served for parties, and having a set of fun glasses makes this drink even more enjoyable.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="12_Hurricane">12. Hurricane</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/12.Hurricane-Glass-min.png" alt="Hurricane glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>This is a very familiar shaped glass and is so named after the drink being poured into hurricane-shaped glasses. A staple in New Orleans, this glass adds a lot of flair to any bar.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="13_Poco_Grande">13. Poco Grande</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/13.Poco-Grande-Glasses-min.png" alt="Poco Grande Glass Set" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Similar to a hurricane glass, the poco grande has a longer stem that makes the drink sit up a little higher. It’s a very attractive glass to showcase beautiful beverages and perfect for cold or blended drinks as the warmth from the person’s hand will not negatively affect the quality of the drink. With a rounder bottom and a smaller mouth, it’s a much daintier glass than some of the other bar glasses available and is a nice addition to any home bar.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="14_Sour">14. Sour</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/14.Sour-Glass.jpg" alt="Sour glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Some people know this glass better as a Delmonico glass. It has a stem, a wide opening, and almost looks like a smaller champagne flute. Generally used to serve whiskey sours and other sour drinks, it holds about 5 ounces. The opening directs the smell and flavor of the drink directly to the nose of the person enjoying the beverage. They can be difficult to find, so in a pinch a smaller champagne glass is a great replacement.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="15_Milkshake">15. Milkshake</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/15.milkshake-glass-min.png" alt="Milkshake glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>These glasses look retro in the best way possible. Anyone who has ever been to a soda fountain before will remember drinking a milkshake out of one of these glasses. They have a very distinctive shape, with a wide opening for the mouth and gently curving sides that end in a large, heavy foot. This is to be sure that the drink does not spill and allows the person enjoying it to stir it with a straw.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="16_Coupe">16. Coupe</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/16.Coupe-Glasses-min.png" alt="Coupe-glasses" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>This long-stemmed glass has a very wide and shallow bowl that brings a certain retro quality to the drinks that you’re serving. They are often used to serve drinks such as the Side Car, Martinez, and Aviation. They can be a little tricky to drink out of because of how shallow and top heavy they are, but they add a lot of glamour to your drik and many people think that they are worth the extra fuss and effort. </p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="17_Snifter">17. Snifter</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/17.Snifter.jpg" alt="Snifter" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Brandy snifters have been perfectly designed to improve the drinking experience of any brandy. With their classic shape that is easily recognizable, nothing will stand in as a good substitute. It’s important to have quality brandy snifters to ensure that you have the best experience when drinking. The right shape and size mouth will greatly improve the drinking experience.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="18_Wobble">18. Wobble</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/18.Wobble-Glasses-min.png" alt="Wobble bar glasses" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>This glass is great to use if you want an updated version of a brandy snifter or brandy glass. They are contemporary and look great at any home bar and rely on their wide mouth to help intensify the flavor of the beverage. It can be tricky to keep the glass from falling over if you aren’t careful, but correctly designed wobble glasses generally are sturdy enough to prevent this from happening. They are a fun way to serve a drink and are sure to invite conversation when you have people over for a beverage.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="19_Nosing">19. Nosing</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/19.Nosing-Glass-min.png" alt="Nosing drink glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>These glasses are specifically made to help capture the aroma and the flavor of the drink. Because of this, they are generally used when drinking straight whiskey. The wider bottom narrows to the top, and this top can sometimes flare out a little so that the aroma is allowed to waft out of the glass. They are heavy enough and have enough weight to them that they are not as fragile as some other available glasses. Because of this there is not as big of a risk of them being knocked over as there is with some other types of glasses.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="20_Pousse_Cafe">20. Pousse Café</h3>

  <img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B01N41FF3O&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>This glass was created to serve beautifully layered drinks. The gentle curve in from the wider bottom makes it very easy to layer drinks without worrying about the layers blending in together. They are rather small and generally hold less than 4 ounces. In addition to being ideal for layered drinks, these glasses work very well for serving liqueur. Again, because of the longer stem, these glasses ensure that the drink will not get warm. The attractive design and shape of the glass only serve to enhance the attractiveness of the drink, especially when it is layered. Careful pouring ensures that the layers stay separate and are able to be clearly seen.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="21_Cordial">21. Cordial</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/21.Cordial-Glasses-min.png" alt="Cordial glass set" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Holding only 2 ounces, this is a very small glass but still a great one to have in any bar. Just like the Pousse Café, it does a great job holding and displaying layered drinks and is often used for an after dinner aperitif or for liqueur. It is perfect for this because most people will not want a lot of a sweet drink after they have eaten a large meal. While some people will serve cordials in other glasses, especially brandy snifters, these glasses have been perfectly made to ensure that they offer the best flavor possible from the beverage.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="22_Grappa">22. Grappa</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/22.Grappa-glass-min.png" alt="Grappa glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Grappa glasses are named after the drink that they were created to hold. Grappa is a very fragrant beverage and is sensitive to temperature changes, hence the long stem on the glasses. The very narrow and small bowl curves in sharply before opening in a dramatic flair. Not only does this look very attractive, but it ensures that the drinker is able to enjoy the full aroma of their beverage. If you enjoy drinking grappa then you know that there is really no good substitute for this glass. Due to its unique shape, it has been perfectly made to capture the flavor and aroma of the beverage and ensure that the drinker is able to fully enjoy it. Using a different glass will decrease the enjoyment of drinking grappa.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="23_Liqueur">23. Liqueur</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23.Liqueur-Glass-min.png" alt="Liqueur glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>These smaller glasses are ideal for holding and serving sweet liqueur. In general, most people will not want to drink a lot of liqueur at one time, so these small glasses are a great portion. They offer a very flared opening that allows the drinker to bring their nose close to the surface of their beverage, intensifying the smell. Some liqueur glasses are very dainty and can be easily broken, so it’s important to make sure that the ones you have are strong enough to stand up to use. Of course, thinner glass will make for a more attractive drink and glass.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="24_Shot_Glasses">24. Shot Glasses</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/24.Shot-Glasses-min.png" alt="Shot glasses" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Used primarily to take shots of liquor, these glasses are shorter than all of the others and generally fairly skinny. You can buy ones that are a bit more conical in shape, although some are just straight-sided cylinders. They come in all kinds of styles and appearances and are often picked up as a souvenir when people are traveling. The design of the shot glass does not at all affect the function, and plain ones can easily be stacked in a cupboard or on the bar until they are needed. Since they are used so quickly, there is no need for a long stem to protect the flavor and aroma of the drink.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="25_Shooter">25. Shooter</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/25.Shooter-Glasses-min.png" alt="Shooter glass" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Shooter glasses are taller than shot glasses and may flare out slightly at the top. While shot glasses are generally used to serve a single serving of alcohol, shooter glasses are large enough to hold a mixture. This makes them ideal for serving custom mixed drinks that need to be drunk quickly as a shot. In addition, for people who want to take a double or triple shot, these glasses can be used in a pinch. Of course, this makes it more difficult to drink all of the liquid at once, but can make for an enjoyable drink.</p>

  <p>Acrylic glasses have come a long way in recent years. Far from being easy to break, they are now sturdy pieces of drinkware that will enhance your drinking experience. They come in a number of colors that you can choose from and are not nearly as easy to break as glass.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="2_Copper">2. Copper</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-mule-mug-hz-031918.jpg" alt="Copper glasses are not only good-looking, they are beneficial to your health too." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Some people argue that there are health benefits to using copper cups while others just enjoy the way that they look. No matter what camp you are in, there are some amazing copper glasses out there for you to choose from. Whether you want all of your glasses to be copper or just want to accent with a few pieces, they’re both beautiful and functional.</p>

  <h3 id="3_Polycarbonate">3. Polycarbonate</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/polycarbonate-steamless-wine-glass-hay-031918.jpg" alt="Polycarbonate wine glasses that do not shatter when fallen." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>Made from a strong, clear plastic, these glasses will stand up to being dropped, will last a long time, and won’t shatter if they do break. In addition, they can be put in the dishwasher without worrying about damaging them and won’t discolor with age. </p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="4_Crystal">4. Crystal</h3>

  <img src="https://www.homestratosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/silver-crystal-wine-glass-hz-031918.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

  <p>While they tend to break more easily than other glasses, crystal glasses feel pleasantly heavy when you hold them, are very attractive, and tend to be much more ornate than some of the other types of glasses available.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h3 id="5_Glass">5. Glass</h3>

  <p>If you love the look of crystal but not the price tag that comes with them, then you will want to consider glass as your material of choice for your new bar glasses. While not as durable as polycarbonate, it is still a great option for anyone looking for beautiful glasses that will last – as long as you don’t drop them.</p>

  <p>Depending on what you are drinking, you may enjoy the slight tang that is commonly felt when you drink from these glasses. Even if you are not drinking something acidic, you may enjoy the appearance of these glasses as something a little different than what anyone else will have.</p>
